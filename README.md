# Model-Assessment-and-transformation
This repository contains a detailed analysis and enhancement of linear regression models, focusing on residual analysis and model transformation techniques. The project aims to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model and apply statistical methods to improve its fit.
Technologies Used: **R: For conducting statistical analysis, creating plots, and performing transformations.**

Objectives:
Data Exploration and Preparation:
- Load and examine the dataset datatrans.csv.
- Prepare data for linear regression analysis.

Initial Regression Analysis:
- Estimate the regression equation.
- Calculate predicted values and residuals.
- Create a comprehensive table showing x values, y values, predicted values, and residuals.

Residual Analysis:
- Plot residuals to assess constant variance and pattern.
- Use normal Q-Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test to evaluate the normality of residuals.
- Conduct the Brown-Forsythe test to check for homoscedasticity.

Model Improvement:
- Apply Box-Cox transformation to address residual issues and meet regression assumptions.
- Transform the response variable and evaluate the enhanced model fit.
- Compare residuals and diagnostic plots before and after transformation.
  
Documentation:
- Model_transform.rmd: R Markdown file detailing the code for data processing, regression analysis, and transformation.
- model_transform.docx: Word document with a detailed report of the analysis, including findings and interpretations.

Files:
Model_transform.rmd: Contains the R code for performing data analysis, residual analysis, and model transformation.
model_transform.docx: Includes a comprehensive report on the results and insights derived from the analysis.

Key Findings:
Analysis of residuals to identify issues with variance and normality.
Application of Box-Cox transformation to improve model performance.
Comparison of original and transformed models to assess improvements.
Explore the provided code and documentation to understand the steps involved in model assessment and the impact of transformation techniques on regression analysis.
